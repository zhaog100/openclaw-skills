## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agents use this skill to exercise REST endpoints, validate status, timing, and response keys, benchmark latency, test OpenAPI specs, and create shareable reports. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Requests can send Authorization headers, request bodies, or state-changing methods to the wrong endpoint. <br>
Mitigation: Use staging endpoints and least-privilege test tokens when possible, verify URLs before sending sensitive data, and review POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, benchmark, and test-all runs before execution. <br>
Risk: Verbose output or generated HTML reports can contain secrets, personal data, or internal API details. <br>
Mitigation: Review generated reports before sharing them and delete report files when they may contain sensitive response data. <br>
