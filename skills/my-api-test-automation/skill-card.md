This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[huahuaweiwei](https://clawhub.ai/user/huahuaweiwei) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and QA engineers use this skill to convert API documentation into executable test suites, configure request setup and response assertions, run the suite in a selected environment, and produce pass/fail reports with coverage notes. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Generated test suites can send real requests to user-provided APIs, including create, update, or delete operations. <br>
Mitigation: Review the base URL, credentials, pre-request scripts, and mutating cases before execution; prefer non-production environments and test tokens. <br>
Risk: Generated tests may use sensitive authentication material supplied through environment files or variables. <br>
Mitigation: Keep secrets in environment variables or approved secret files, avoid hard-coding credentials in generated cases, and confirm authorization before sending requests. <br>
