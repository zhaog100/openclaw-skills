## Description: <br>
API Test Automation helps agents create and run REST and GraphQL API tests, including functional, performance, contract, mock-service, and reporting workflows. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[kaiyuelv](https://clawhub.ai/user/kaiyuelv) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and QA engineers use this skill to generate and run API test automation for REST and GraphQL services, including contract checks, load testing, mock services, and test reports. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: API, load, or contract tests can affect live services if run against systems the user does not own or is not authorized to test. <br>
Mitigation: Run generated tests only against owned or explicitly authorized development, staging, or test systems. <br>
Risk: The mock server captures requests in an in-memory log, which can retain credentials or sensitive payloads sent during testing. <br>
Mitigation: Use test credentials and sanitized payloads, and avoid sending real secrets through mock-server scenarios. <br>
Risk: The skill depends on multiple Python packages that may change behavior or expose vulnerabilities over time. <br>
Mitigation: Pin and audit dependencies before using the skill in CI or shared development environments. <br>
