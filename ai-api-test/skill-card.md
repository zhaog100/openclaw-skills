### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to send authorized test requests to API endpoints and receive a local Markdown summary of status code, latency, content length, and response preview. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The generated report can include a local preview of the API response body. <br>
Mitigation: Run the skill only against APIs you own or are authorized to test, and avoid sensitive endpoints unless local response previews are acceptable. <br>
Risk: The release advertises monitoring, load-testing, and advanced validation features that are not evidenced in the current implementation. <br>
Mitigation: Treat this version as a basic API request/report helper and verify any advanced workflow before relying on it for monitoring, CI/CD gates, or performance testing. <br>
